# EasyML

EasyML is a machine learning framework designed to simplify the training of machine learning models. It is intended for non-expert users who want to leverage the power of these algorithms, but may not have a deep understanding of programming.

EasyML uses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) called TextX, which is written in Python. This allows users to access the power of machine learning algorithms in a more abstract and user-friendly way, without needing to be proficient in Python. The goal of EasyML is to provide a more accessible and user-friendly way of training machine learning models, making it possible for a wider range of users to take advantage of these powerful tools.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced machine learning practitioner, EasyML provides a simple and intuitive way to train machine learning models and access the benefits of these algorithms.
